## 🎉 ParadeGame

A personal recreation of the classic *Parade* card game — entirely playable in your terminal using Java. This project is designed with a focus on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and clean, modular design.

## 📌 Introduction  
Hi there! I'm excited to present **ParadeGame**, a Java-based terminal version of the *Parade* card game. This solo project showcases my understanding of OOP concepts, Java programming, and user experience design in a text-based interface.

## 🛠️ Features  
- 🤖 **AI Opponent:** Play against a smart computer player with logic-based decision-making.  
- 🎚️ **Difficulty Options:** Choose from multiple difficulty levels to suit your skill and challenge level.  
- 🎨 **Colorful UI:** Enjoy a visually engaging experience with terminal-based color formatting and styled game output.  
- 🧱 **OOP Architecture:** Built using clean, maintainable object-oriented design with encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction.  
- 📝 **Auto-Generated Documentation:** Easily explore the codebase through generated Javadoc documentation.
